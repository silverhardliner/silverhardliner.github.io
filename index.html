        <p>
            Welcome to my web development journey! I am currently learning the ropes of web development,
            and I'm excited to share two projects that I have completed:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="cat_photo_app.html">Cat Photo App</a> - A fun project showcasing adorable cat photos.</li>
            <li><a href="cafe_menu.html">Cafe Menu</a> - Explore the menu of a cozy cafe with this project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Feel free to check them out and let me know what you think! I'm eager to continue learning and
            expanding my web development skills.
